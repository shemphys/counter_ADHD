# counter_TDAH
 I'm exploring ways of countering TDAH bad symptoms.
 My goal is to patch myself with funny stupid scripts xD

- [reminder](https://github.com/shemphys/counter_TDAH/tree/main/reminder): it pops a matrix rain and loops an audio reminding me what I was doing. It is very raw, no menu, the way to stop it is by using Ctrl+C. It does the job, I don't want it to be more complex rn (because it is just for me atm)

- [habit_tracker](https://github.com/shemphys/counter_TDAH/tree/main/habit_tracker): Having in mind that you cannot just rip off a habit you could have, it allows me to keep track of the habits I want to develop just to push the unwanted ones.
